The structure groups and monoids of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang--Baxter Equation can be regarded as deformations of free abelian groups resp. monoids. In this work, we obtain explicit formulae for the growth series of the structure groups and monoids of transposition and dihedral quandles, and of the structure groups of permutation quandles. These quandles provide important families of YBE solutions. The intricate nature of our formulae confirms that, while preserving many nice properties of free abelian groups, even the simplest structure groups and monoids are remarkably rich objects. We also establish some structural properties and easily computable normal forms for the monoids considered.
