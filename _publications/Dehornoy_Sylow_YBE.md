We explain how the germ of the structure group of a cycle set decomposes as a product of its Sylow-subgroups, and how this process can be reversed to construct cycle sets from ones with coprime classes. We study the Dehornoyâ€™s class associated to a cycle set, and conjecture a bound that we prove in a specific case. We combine the use of braces and a monomial representation, in particular to answer a question by Dehornoy on retrieving the Garside structure without a theorem of Rump, while also retrieving said theorem.
