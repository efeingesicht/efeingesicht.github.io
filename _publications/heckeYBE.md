We define a concept of Hecke algebra for structure groups of set-theoretical solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation. As a comparison to Artin--Tits groups of spherical type, we study some properties of this construction, while also highlighting some differences that appear, which shows a difference between finite Coxeter groups and the "Coxeter-like" group introduced by Dehornoy. We also relate this definition to known constructions on solutions (retractions). Finally, we study a particular case related to Torus Knot groups and Complex Reflexion groups.
